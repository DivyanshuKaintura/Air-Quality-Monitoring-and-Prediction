# Air-Quality-Monitoring-and-Prediction

### How to start the application

run the air.py

## `python air.py`

Enter the name of city who want to know the air quality of and the program will suggest you the measures to be taken according to the air quality.

We are aiming to determine the air quality of a place at real-time and suggest measures to local according to the quality.
We used openWeather API for determining the details of air of a place
We used geopy library to get the latitudes and longitudes of a place
We trained our model using the given dataset to predict the conditions.
Compared multiple ML alogirthms and found that Random Forest Classifier was best with the accuracy result of more than 99%.

## Tech stack
1. Language used: Python
2. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india?select=city_day.csv
3. Machine Learning model used: Random Forest Classifier
4. Frameworks and library used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, joblib, geopy
5. API used: openweathermap


## Social and Economic Effect
1. Predicting the air quality can help people decide their life style
2. This can help the government to take required steps
3. They can study the pattern of change of air quality over time to take proper initiatives

## Future Work
Due to the lack of time because we had mid-terms exam we were not able to make more of it. After exams we can add multiple features to it. 
We will use Intel Tech for development instead of the used ones.
